# Hello, I'm Marco Consoloni!

I am a PhD student at the Department of Information Engineering (DII) of the University of Pisa.
My research focuses on developing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Vision–Language (VL) models to extract engineering knowledge from technical documents, with the goal of supporting data-driven design innovation. I am particularly interested in studying how Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision–Language (VL) methods can be used to extract and generate information from both text and images, in order to support engineers and designers throughout the New Product Development (NPD) process.
